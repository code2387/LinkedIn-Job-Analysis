This project aims to analyze the current job landscape on LinkedIn, focusing on available job opportunities, the impact of alumni networks, types of jobs, and work arrangements. By examining various job postings and user profiles, we will explore trends in remote versus on-site work, in-demand job categories, and the influence of alumni connections on job placements. The analysis will provide insights into how these factors shape the job market, helping job seekers make informed decisions and guiding organizations in understanding the dynamics of talent acquisition. Ultimately, this project seeks to present a comprehensive view of LinkedIn's role in the modern job search ecosystem.
